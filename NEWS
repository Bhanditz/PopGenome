Changes in PopGenome 1.2.1
=========================

BUGS FIXED:

- sliding.window.transform(): BUG in concatenating the regions 
- readSNP(): chromosome-ids like "1","2" ... are also accepted.
- the functon concatenate_to_whole_genome() is now visible
- load.session()


NEW FEATURES:

- scan the data now from a start to an end-position (sliding.window.transform())
- using the bigmemory package for HUGE data sets
- vignettes on CRAN


Changes in PopGenome 1.2.0
=========================

- new implemented C++ functions to read alignments in several formats
- using the ff-package to handle big data
- reading SNP data from 1000/1001 Genome project
- new features (create.PopGenome.method, region.as.fasta ...)
- set.synnonsyn() to verify synonymous/non-synonymous sites of SNP-data 
- new methods (Achaz, ...)
- speed up calculations (C++ functions, multicore computation)
- splitting.data() to analyse subsites like exon, gene, intron ...
